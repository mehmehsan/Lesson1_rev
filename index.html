        </h2>
        <p> There are a lot ways to let everyone know how to make them happy and the fact is that they even know that,
            but can't make daily efforts to make it out of it. This application will tend to add values, thoughts,
            experience and make everyone go through a <strong> Happy Life ! </strong></p>

        <h2>
            Daily tasks
        </h2>
        <p> All you have to do today is make a thought that to thank for every body and and everything you get your
            life. It's just because of all sub-ordinates that you come here. Give a special thanks to parents, friends
            and teachers you get in your life rather than the Bosses 😂. </p>

        <p>And ultimately say thanks to God, I don't want to end with any controversy that god exists or not but I
            belive in a strong immense force that binds universe. So, something that binds whole universe have something
            great, belive in that power.</p>
